# MIT App Inventor Project

## AI2 Project Idea:
### This was the suggested app idea I chose the create.

"For the AI2 project Iâ€™d like to build an app that allows the user to sort and throw the items in the correct bins, The app would allow the user to decide between recycling, trash, or compost, and throw or (shoot) the items into the correct bins. The app would help with social impact by educating the user on which bins the items can go into and help to build environmentally friendly habits.  Some features of my app include, A bell noise, a score board, a vibration effect, different animations related to the theme and movement of the items by touch. The audience for my app is children, the idea is to help the children build knowledge and fundamental skills that can positively impact the environment and their communities".

<!--Notes to follow for this readme: This documentation should serve as a comprehensive guide to your project, covering aspects such as the platforms utilized, the features developed, the motivation behind the application, and the development process. Essentially, this documentation should reflect your application's journey and the insights gained throughout the project. If you're unsure how to structure or write the documentation, refer to the following example from the previous term for guidance on preparing effective project documentation:-->


## Platforms used to complete this project:
- I used **MIT App Inventor**, app get the gold which I had just finished completing and handing in. I used the codes to begin structuring my code, with a plan of altering the code, and deleting or adding features to it until it was a completely new code, and new app. 
- I used a **Youtube MIT App Inventor video**, to help me to understand how the functions work, and try to solve an issue I was having with one of my functions related to colliding of the imageSprites. 

## Features of the app: 
- Six imageSprites (Three are litter: "Bottle", "Trash", "Banana peel". Three are Bins: "Recycle bin", "Garbage bin", "Organic bin")
- There is a "Canvas", which is the main game area, where the actions of the game take place.  
- The "Clean Up!", button which will reset the program, and begin fun game music in the background. 
- The "Done", button will stop all functions, and music, turn all imageSprites to not visible. 
- **Alerts** the user if the action was correct by showing the word "Correct", if the user has been successful in depositing the item in the correct bin. This is accompanied by a "Positive sound", and **Green** colour is shown as a background colour when the alert takes place. 
- **Alerts** the user if the action was not correct by showing the word "Wrong", if the user has been successful in depositing the item in the correct bin. This is accompanied by a "Negative sound", and green **Red** is shown as a background colour when the alert takes place.  
- The app has a **Score Board** 0/10 which updates as the user gets the items into the correct bins. 
- When the score has reached its top limit **10/10**, it will reset to **0/10**, and a surprise image will be shown, accompanied by a fun sound effect, that is complimenting the user. 
  

## Motivations 
- My first and largest motivation, is my children, I tried to think of a way to make this project into something that would inspire my children. A game that I can make fun and interactive, that would show them what you can create if you put your mind to it. 
- I was motivated to do a project of this design due to the program that I have just finished debugging, and handing in called **"Get The Gold"**. 
- I enjoy creating interactive designs in websites, and I have a growing passion, in creating fun and interactive designs, games. 
- I felt If this project was fun, I would excel at it, and impress my teacher.
- I wanted to have fun creating this project. (I had fun)

## App creating journey:

- This application began as a slightly different version of the **"Get The Gold"** app. My programming skills are not as strong as I would like, so I decided to approach this project this way.
